============
 About Purp
============

 Purp is a ncurses-based RPM-handler. The goal has been to provide 
 an interactive and efficient way to handle RPM-packages on ordinary
 text-terminals. 
 
 RPM (RedHat Package Manager) is RedHats system for packaging, 
 distribution, installation, upgrade and uninstallation of source
 and binary software-distributions. Information about RPM can be
 found at <http://www.rpm.org/>, and information about RedHat can
 be found at <http://www.redhat.com/>.
 
 The program has an interactive user interface with two panels 
 showing installed and available packages. The panels can be
 navigated either as the text-based WWW-client Lynx, or as file-
 handle-systems as Midnight Commander. A third panel shows 
 information about the currently selected package.  
 
 The interface is controlled by short key-commands, which are 
 shown and explained at the bottom of the screen. 

 More information about Purp, and new versions are available at
 this address: <http://www.lysator.liu.se/purp/>

 Installing
============

 Read the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

 Usage info
============

 Starting Purp:
 -------------------------------------------
 Purp is normally started like this:
 [root@pudas /root]# purp /mnt/redhat/contrib/i386/  

 Where the only argument is the path to a directory containing RPM-
 packages. If Purp is started without a path to a directory with
 RPM-packages it will only show the installed packages, leaving the
 other panel empty.

 If the user that runs Purp isn't root, and therefore haven't 
 write-permission for the RPM-database, then Purp will start
 in a limited mode for normal users.

 To see more information about options, use the option '--help':
 [root@pudas /root]# purp --help
 
 
 Navigating the packages:
 -------------------------------------------
 The packages are navigated by using the selection-bar, which is 
 the bar that stands over one of the packages, and that can be
 moved by the arrow-keys.
 
 The following keys are used to move the selection-bar:
 
         [TAB] - Switch panels (move bar to the other panel)

    [Arrow up] - Move selection-bar one line up
  [Arrow down] - Move selection-bar one line down
 
     [Page Up] - Move selection-bar one page up
   [Page Down] - Move selection-bar one page down
 
 [Arrow right] - Move down into the currently selected folder
  [Arrow left] - Move up, back to previous folder
  
       [Enter] - Enter the currently selected folder
                 (Down if ordinary folder or up if it's '..')
       
      [Insert] - Mark the currently selected package for
                 operations like install, upgrade or uninstall. 


 
 Searching for packages:
 -------------------------------------------
 Purp now provides a simple search-function, that can search for
 package-names. For the moment the search-function is very simple,
 it only search for packages matching the name, not version- or 
 release-number. You don't need to enter the whole package-name,
 you can enter as many as needed to make it significant. 

 To search for a package, you must first select the panel in which 
 you want to search, for example if you want to search among your 
 installed packages you place the cursor in the left panel. Then 
 press 'S', enter a part of the package-name at the search-prompt, 
 and finally press 'enter'.

 A package-name is built like this:
 
      name-version-release
 
 Which means that if you want to search for the package
 'kernel-2.0.32-3', then you enter 'kern' at the search-prompt.
 
 If Purp finds a matching package then it will navigate to that
 package and place the cursor above it.



Follow-command for easier navigation:
 -------------------------------------------
 Purp 0.3.0 introduced the Follow-command, which navigates the
 panel that aren't active (the one without selection-bar) to the 
 same folder (if available) in the hierarchy as the active panel.
 
 For example if you stand in the folder "/utilities/system", in
 then available-panel, and wants to see what packages you have 
 installed in the same folder, then you can press "F" to 
 autmatically navigate the installed-panel to "/utilities/system".
 


 Performing RPM-operations:
 -------------------------------------------
 The operations that are available are shown at the command-line
 at the bottom of the screen. For each command there is a letter
 highlighted showing the key for that command. The command-line
 alters to always show only the available commands.

 Purp ofcourse supports the basic package-operations as installation,
 upgrade and uninstallation of packages. Purp also have functions
 to show detailed information about packages, for example lists 
 of the files in a package, the scripts in a package, and the
 dependencies for a package. All these operations are performed
 by key-commands.



 Redraw the screen:
 -------------------------------------------
 You can redraw the Purp-user-interface by pressing Ctrl-L.
 
 
==================
 Terminal devices
==================
 
 Purp has been tested on many different kinds of text-terminals,
 and it seems to work on at least most of the ones tested. 
 
 The minimum size of the terminal is 60 * 14. Ofcourse it's 
 possible to run Purp on bigger terminals.

 Purp uses color when available, for example on a Linux-
 console when the environment-variable TERM is set to 
 'linux' or in a 'rxvt' or 'color-xterm' when TERM is set 
 to 'xterm-color'.
